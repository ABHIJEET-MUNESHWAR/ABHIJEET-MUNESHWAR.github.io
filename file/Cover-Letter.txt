Hi,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in a role where Generative AI, advanced system design, and LLM integration are core to the product vision. With 13+ years of engineering experience (including 6 years in leadership roles), I bring a unique blend of deep back-end expertise, GenAI innovation, and performance-focused design thinking.

At Cleo, I architected a GenAI-based Anomaly Detection System leveraging Multi-Model MCP Servers, Clients, and RAG pipelines, which improved anomaly detection rates by 60â€“85%, saving ~$150K annually. I also built a scalable audit log system (1.5 billion log entries/day) integrating LLMs and RAG that saved ~$250K yearly in operational cost.

During my time at DeepIntent, I developed an LLM-powered Co-Pilot that improved campaign delivery by 32%, resulting in $1M+ in campaign savings. I also created an in-house anomaly detection platform using GenAI + MCPs, cutting down losses by ~$200K/year.

My toolbox includes:

LLMOps & GenAI: GPT-4, Claude, RAG, Vector DBs, LangChain, LangGraph, LLM Evaluation, Prompt Orchestration, MCP Servers

System Design: Event-driven systems, Clean architecture, Large-scale distributed systems, Resilient and fault tolerant systems.

Data Structures & Algorithms: 1100+ LeetCode problems solved, Hackerrank Silver medals, system performance tuning

Back-End: Java, Spring Boot, Golang, Python, FlastAPI, Node.js, MySQL, Kafka, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Redis, GraphQL, Apache Airflow, Spark, Flink, Beam, AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, ELK, Graphana, Prometheus.

Front-End: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js

I thrive in product-first engineering cultures and am passionate about building AI-native systems that are scalable, intelligent, and cost-efficient.
